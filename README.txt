This is a Zenpack for monitoring Adva FSP150 optical transport equipment.

It has only been tested against the FSP150CC GE-112.  Other models may be
detected but there are no performance monitoring templates for them.  The
zenpack is written so that other models will be detected and if a performance
monitoring template with the same name as the model is created then it will be
applied to the slot.  The NetPort template assumes a Y.1731 test is running
every 5 minutes.
